//! The worldgen world hash — the port of `WorldGenerator.HashWorld`
//! (`WorldBuilding/WorldGenerator.cs:517-545`), the per-pipeline fingerprint
//! vanilla records into `GenPassResult.Hash` and compares across snapshot
//! runs (`CheckLatestPassResultAgainstManifest`).
//!
//! The fold structure is verbatim: per column, XOR the tile hashes and mix
//! with `h = rotl13(h) * 5 + 3864292196` (the FNV-1a finaliser family,
//! unchecked u32 arithmetic), then the same mix across the column hashes.
//! The per-tile field mix is the port's own — C# hashes via
//! `TileSnapshot.TileStruct.GetHashCode()`, whose .NET internals are not
//! worth reproducing; what matters is that every stored `Tile` field is
//! covered (kind, wall, frame_x, frame_y, liquid, flags, meta, wall_frame —
//! the state the `.trwld` save serialises) and the result is stable.
